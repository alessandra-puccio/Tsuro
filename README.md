A two-person board game in which players place tiles on a board and attempt to create the longest path through their tiles. Players can choose the size of their board before beginning gameplay. Players can rotate their tiles before placing them on the board. Player 1 must place their first tile in the left-most column of the board and Player 2 must place their first tile in the right-most column of the board. For every following turn, they can only place their tile in a square that borders their previously placed tile. Player loses when they stone moves down a pathway and hits a wall.
